# Dinner Party

Jessica Holm

This code tries to maximize the score of guests and hosts at a dinner party.

Run with `python3 dinner.py [filename] [solver] [desired score]`.

Solver can be `random` or `local`.

My testing was done on Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL) under Ubuntu using a Intel i5-4460 CPU @ 3.20GHz.
